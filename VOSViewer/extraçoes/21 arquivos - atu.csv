This paper presents a machine learning-driven dynamic pricing approach designed to optimize ticket prices across multiple transportation modes, service classes, and sales channels. In particular, the proposed approach integrates predictive analytics and optimization techniques to estimate customer demand, price sensitivity, and revenue potential while accounting for operational constraints such as capacity limits and market share requirements. Machine learning enables the optimization model to dynamically adjust pricing strategy based on historical demand patterns and real time market fluctuations. To demonstrate its applicability, the approach is applied in a case study in the transportation sector, illustrating its role in optimizing pricing decisions. Additionally, sensitivity analysis highlights the model's robustness against capacity changes, demand fluctuations, and pricing constraints. The findings emphasize the role of supply chain analytics in enhancing pricing strategy, making them more adaptive, data-driven, and resilient to market dynamics. © 2025 The Authors;"Dynamic pricing; Machine learning; Multi-channel supply chain; Revenue optimization; Supply chain resiliency; Transportation analytics";;"Afsharian, M., Data science essentials in business administration: a multidisciplinary perspective (2024) Decis.

Product pricing is widely considered to be one of the key determinants of the development of the CBEC industry. Therefore, CBEC platforms enable many platform merchants to flourish through unique pricing strategy. A comprehensive understanding of these pricing strategy is essential for exploring the nature of innovative business models. Taking Lazada, a leading CBEC platform in Southeast Asia, as an example, this paper analyzes the commodity information data set of electronic products as of November 8,2024, and develops a multi-factor price prediction model by using natural language processing and machine learning technology. The study used three different prediction methods: linear regression, random forest and XGBoost. By comparing the prediction performance of the three methods, the random forest method has the strongest prediction ability. In addition, the random forest model is used for attribution analysis to help platform merchants formulate appropriate prices. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

This paper proposes an optimization-based product sampling strategy to improve sales promotion and profits using recurrent neural networks (RNN) method. Unlike conventional selling modes, the strategy allows consumers to purchase discounted product samples while receiving coupons for subsequent full-priced purchases. A profit optimization model is formulated incorporating constraints such as production costs. The methodological breakthrough lies in introducing RNN to solve this constrained optimization problem, offering a novel approach to dynamic pricing and marketing strategy optimization. In addition, a projection method has been introduced to avoid the additional operation of normalizing product prices in existing methods. The proposed RNN-based framework ensures real time adaptability, robustness, and efficient convergence, which addresses the complexities of sample distribution and coupon redemption and provides a new perspective on pricing strategy for retailers. The feasibility and effectiveness of the model are demonstrated through numerical simulations, providing valuable insights for retailers seeking promotion-driven pricing strategy. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2025.;"Optimization with constraints; Projection operator; Recurrent neural networks; Sale promotion";"Neural-networks; Optimisations; Optimization models; Optimization with constraint; Pricing strategy; Product optimization; Projection neural network; Projection Operator; Sales promotions; Uncertainty; Sales";"Cheng, X., Deng, S., Jiang, X., Li, Y., Optimal promotion strategies of online marketplaces (2023) Eur J Oper Res, 306 (3), pp. 1264-1278; Li, Z., Guan, X., Mei, W., Coupon promotion and its cross-channel effect in omnichannel retailing industry: a time-sensitive strategy (2023) Int J Prod Econ, 258; Feng, N., Chen, J., Feng, H., Li, M., Promotional pricing strategy for platform vendors: competition between first- and third-party products (2021) Decis Support Syst, 151; Edelman, B., Jaffe, S., Kominers, S.D., To groupon or not to groupon: The profitability of deep discounts (2014) Mark Lett, 27 (1), pp. 39-53; Khouja, M., Pan, J., Zhou, J., Effects of gift cards on optimal order and discount of seasonal products (2016) Eur J Oper Res, 248 (1), pp. 159-173. , 3393506; Mao, Z., Yuan, R., Wang, J., Precision marketing for newly-launched products: How to offer free trials to consumers?

The marketing teams develop digital marketing tactics to attract traffic to their e-commerce sites and increase sales volume. With the vast amount of data provided by the cloud, decisions that were previously made with a significant level of intuition based on the knowledge and experience of decision-makers can now be backed using artificial intelligence algorithms. To identify the variables influencing pricing decisions for products launched on e-commerce shopping sites and to develop variable pricing techniques for each product found on an e-commerce site. This paper introduces a novel approach that applies Fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) and Fuzzy TOPSIS MCDM methodology. A B2B e-commerce marketing store based in Hong Kong has created and implemented Smart-Quo, a pricing decision support system for B2B e-commerce retail businesses. After a six-month trial period, there has been a substantial advance in the effectiveness and efficiency of choosing prices for each product. The case study illustrates the viability and potential advantages of implementing artificial intelligence tools in marketing management in the digital era. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.;"artificial intelligence;

The primary objective is to develop a pricing model that effectively balances profitability with customer satisfaction by leveraging sequential data, such as time-series and customer behavior patterns. The approach utilizes LSTM’s ability to capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, while optimization methods like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) enhance model convergence and performance. Key findings include the superior predictive accuracy of LSTM-based models over traditional approaches like Linear Regression and Decision Trees, particularly in real time data updates and price elasticity scenarios. Additionally, the analysis revealed that LSTM models could efficiently adapt pricing strategy in response to market dynamics, significantly improving profitability while maintaining customer satisfaction. This study provides valuable insights into the application of advanced machine learning techniques in e-commerce pricing. The results suggest that LSTM-based dynamic pricing models could optimize revenue generation, offering substantial implications for pricing strategy development in modern retail environments. Future work may explore hybrid models and multi-objective optimization techniques to further refine these models. © 2013 IEEE.;"customer satisfaction; Dynamic pricing; E-commerce; gradient-based optimization; long short-term memory (LSTM); machine learning; profitability; recurrent neural networks (RNNs); sequential data; stochastic gradient descent (SGD)";"Electronic money; Marketplaces; Mobile commerce; Quality function deployment; Sales; Stochastic models; Customers' satisfaction; Dynamic pricing; Gradient-based optimization; Long short-term memory; machine learning; Neural-networks; Recurrent neural network; Sequential data; Short term memory; Stochastic gradient descent; User experience";"Mathebula, M., Modupe, A., Marivate, V., ChatGPT as a text annotation tool to evaluate sentiment analysis on South African financial institutions (2024) IEEE Access, 12, pp. 144017-144043; Kavousi-Fard, A., Dabbaghjamanesh, M., Jafari, M., Fotuhi-Firuzabad, M., Dong, Z.Y., Jin, T., Digital twin for mitigating solar energy resources challenges: A perspective (2024) Sol.

NLP extracts insights from customer feedback, product descriptions, and social media sentiments to understand customer preferences and market trends. ARIMA, a time-series forecasting model, predicts demand fluctuations based on historical sales data, enabling better stock management, while LSTM captures long-term dependencies in sequential data for more accurate forecasting and product recommendations. By combining these techniques, the system enhances decision-making, optimizes pricing strategy, and improves customer engagement through personalized recommendations. Additionally, it helps businesses maintain an efficient inventory system by reducing overstocking and stockouts, ultimately increasing profitability. This approach not only benefits businesses but also enhances the shopping experience by making e-commerce platforms more adaptive and responsive to changing market demands. The integration of NLP, ARIMA, and LSTM ensures a data-driven strategy that leverages AI and ML to transform the e-commerce industry through predictive analytics and intelligent decision-making. © 2025 IEEE.;"ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated moving average); Data Aggregation; E-Commerce Aggregator; LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory); Natural Language Processing (NLP); Price Comparison; Product Comparison; Sales Forecasting; Unified E-Commerce Platform";"Autoregressive moving average model; Behavioral research; Costs; Data mining; Decision making; E-commerce; Information management; Inventory control; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Sales; Auto-regressive; Autoregressive integrated moving average; Commerce platforms; Data aggregation; E-commerce aggregator; Language processing; Long short-term memory; Moving averages; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Price comparisons; Product comparison; Sales forecasting; Short term memory; Unified E-commerce platform; Long short-term memory";"Senthil, G.A., Prabha, R., Suganthi, S., Sridevi, S., Shanthi, N., (2023) An IoT-Enabled Smart Network Traffic Signal Assistant System for Emergency Vehicles Using Computer Vision, 665. , In: Raj, J.S., Perikos, I., Balas, V.E.

To efficiently respond to changes in demand, accurate demand forecasting is central to the process of making changes in pricing. The main problem with conventional approaches to price determination is that usually there is no way the price can be changed in response to changes in the market. New developments in Fourier Analysis Networks (FANs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) present the potential for improving demand forecasts and price optimization. The objective of this work is to implement FANs for demand forecasting in parallel to an RL agent for dynamic pricing and fine-tune the RL agent via Hyperband as the hyperparameter tuning method to create an efficient and adaptive pricing model. Thus, the integration of time series demand forecast with dynamic pricing mechanism allows for daily business to change their prices according to the forecasted demands, market status, and competitive prices. The hybrid system takes the demand forecast from the FANs to facilitate the RL agent's decision to set appropriate prices. RL agent acts with the environment, changing prices based on the forecasts of demand and stock, as well as the prices of competitors. Hyperband optimization, therefore, refines the hyperparameters of the agent to increase efficiency. The findings show how the implementation of the proposed hybrid system exceeds conventional pricing models. The demand forecast accuracy of the model stood at 95.65% to achieve better revenues uplifts. The presented framework provides the e-commerce companies with the opportunity for better adjustment and implementation of different pricing strategy to increase profitability and minimize the time spent on identification of different conditions on the market. © 2025 IEEE.;"Demand Forecasting; Dynamic Pricing; E-commerce; Fourier Analysis Networks (FANs); Hyperband Optimization; real time Pricing; Reinforcement Learning (RL)";"Artificial intelligence; Competition; Costs; Forecasting; Fourier analysis; Hybrid systems; Optimization; Demand forecasting; Dynamic pricing; Fourier analyze network; Fourier's analysis; Hyperband; Hyperband optimization; Optimisations; Real time pricing; Reinforcement learning; Reinforcement learnings; E-commerce";"Gupta, P., Dynamic Pricing in E-commerce: Strategies & Benefits | Nected Blogs, , https://www.nected.ai/blog/dynamic-pricing-inecommerce, Accessed: Dec. 14 2024; Gerpott, T.J., Berends, J., Competitive pricing on online markets: A literature review (2022) J Revenue Pricing Manag, 21 (6), pp. 596-622. , Dec; Yin, C., Han, J., Dynamic Pricing Model of E-Commerce Platforms Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (2021) Computer Modeling in Engineering & Sciences, 127 (1), pp. 291-307; Takyar, A., AI-powered dynamic pricing solutions: Use cases, architecture and trends LeewayHertz-AI Development Company, , https://www.leewayhertz.com/ai-powered-dynamic-pricingsolution/, Accessed: Dec. 14 2024; Pillai, K.A., (2023) AI-DRIVEN DYNAMIC pricing strategy FOR SUBSCRIPTION FEATURES: LEVERAGING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE FOR real time PRICING OPTIMIZATION, , https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4628041, Nov. 09 Social Science Research Network, Rochester, NY: 4628041.

Through this approach, e-commerce platforms can efficiently leverage machine learning to personalize pricing at an individual customer level, ultimately maximizing revenue opportunities and customer satisfaction. Beyond direct pricing optimization, this method can also be adapted as a robust decision support system for small to medium-sized online retailers. By integrating user-specific purchasing data, the model can help predict optimal pricing actions, enabling businesses to navigate highly competitive markets while maintaining profitability and customer loyalty. One of the key areas of contemporary marketing is the formulation of a pricing strategy, which is one of the four pillars of the traditional marketing mix. One way to implement this strategy is through dynamic pricing. It is currently gaining popularity in many industries for two reasons. Firstly, it is possible, easy, and cheap to collect information about transactions and customers. Secondly, machine learning mechanisms, for which these data are essential, are becoming widely available. The aim of this article is to propose a dynamic pricing method for the e-commerce industry. To achieve this goal, machine learning methods such as the Naive Bayes classifier, support vector machines (linear and nonlinear), decision trees, and the k-nearest neighbor algorithm were used. The empirical results indicate that the linear support vector machine achieved the highest accuracy (86.92%), demonstrating the model’s effectiveness in classifying pricing decisions. This article aligns with two leading research trends in dynamic pricing: personalized dynamic pricing (the target model considers customer-related criteria) and the development of systems to assist managers in optimizing pricing strategy to increase revenues (using machine learning methods). This article presents a literature review on dynamic pricing and then discusses the machine learning methods applied. In the final part of this article, verification of the developed dynamic pricing method using real-world conditions is presented. © 2024 by the authors.;"dynamic pricing; e-commerce; machine learning; pricing strategy";"Costs; Marketplaces; Nearest neighbor search; Sales; Support vector machines; Customer behavior; Dynamic pricing; E-commerce; Machine learning methods; machine learning; Market dynamics; Pricing methods; Pricing strategy; Real- time; Time adjustment; Adversarial machine learning";"Kotler, P., Armstrong, G., (2010) Principles of Marketing, , Pearson Education, London, UK; Shin, D., Vaccari, S., Zeevi, A., Dynamic pricing with online reviews (2023) Manag.

In this context, developing smart and efficient pricing strategy has become a top priority in the industry. Faced with this challenge, traditional pricing methods are inadequate due to their slow response, insufficient adaptability to instant changes in the market, and over-reliance on historical data and human experience. In response to this urgent need, this study aims to design an intelligent pricing model rooted in deep learning to enhance the vitality and competitiveness of the retail industry. The emerging solution adopted in this article combines Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT), Ensemble of Simplified RNNs (ES-RNN), and dynamic attention mechanisms, aiming to accurately capture and analyze complex time series data through these advanced technologies. TFT processes multivariate and multi-level data, ES-RNN technology integrates multiple simple versions of recurrent neural networks to enhance predictive power, and the dynamic attention mechanism allows the model to dynamically weight the importance of different points in the time series, thereby improving the effectiveness of feature extraction. Test experimental results on four different data sets show that our models all show excellent performance, and the accuracy of predicted product sales far exceeds traditional models. In addition, with its ability to dynamically adjust pricing, the model demonstrates excellent stability and adaptability amid market fluctuations. This research not only promotes the intelligent transformation of retail pricing strategy, but also provides a more strategic tool for enterprises to compete for market share. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2024.;"Data analysis; Deep learning; Dynamic pricing; Predictive modeling; Retail industry; Smart pricing";"Commerce; Competition; Costs; Dynamics; Learning systems; Sales; Time series; Attention mechanisms; Deep learning; Dynamic price; Dynamic pricing; Predictive models; Pricing models; Pricing strategy; Retail industry; Sales forecasting; Smart pricing; Recurrent neural networks";"Anitha, P., Patil, M.M., RFM model for customer purchase behavior using k-means algorithm (2022) J King Saud Univ Comput Inform Sci, 34 (5), pp. 1785-1792; Arora, P., Balyan, A., Comparative analysis of LSTM, encoder-decoder and GRU models for stock price prediction (2023) Computational Intelligence: Select Proceedings of Incite 2022, pp. 399-410. , Springer; Bao, T., Ren, N., Luo, R., Wang, B., Shen, G., Guo, T., A Bert-based hybrid short text classification model incorporating CNN and attention-based Bigru (2021) J Organ End User Comput (JOEUC), 33 (6), pp. 1-21; Chen, G., Zhu, D., Chen, X., Similarity detection method of science fiction painting based on multi-strategy improved sparrow search algorithm and gaussian pyramid (2023) Multimed Tools Appl, 2023, pp. 1-40; Cui, F., Hu, H., Xie, Y., An intelligent optimization method of e-commerce product marketing (2021) Neural Comput Appl, 33, pp. 4097-4110; Du, Y., Li, F., Intelligent multi-microgrid energy management based on deep neural network and model-free reinforcement learning (2019) IEEE Trans Smart Grid, 11 (2), pp. 1066-1076; Falatouri, T., Darbanian, F., Brandtner, P., Udokwu, C., Predictive analytics for demand forecasting-a comparison of Sarima and LSTM in retail SCM (2022) Proc Comput Sci, 200, pp. 993-1003; Gao, T., Wang, C., Zheng, J., Wu, G., Ning, X., Bai, X., Yang, J., Wang, J., A smoothing group lasso based interval type-2 fuzzy neural network for simultaneous feature selection and system identification (2023) Knowl Based Syst, 280; Godahewa, R., Bandara, K., Webb, G.I., Smyl, S., Bergmeir, C., Ensembles of localised models for time series forecasting (2021) Knowl Based Syst, 233; Gupta, S., Maulik, A., Das, D., Singh, A., Coordinated stochastic optimal energy management of grid-connected microgrids considering demand response, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and smart transformers (2022) Renew Sustain Energy Rev, 155; Jing, N., Wu, Z., Wang, H., A hybrid model integrating deep learning with investor sentiment analysis for stock price prediction (2021) Expert Syst Appl, 178; John, J.M., Shobayo, O., Ogunleye, B., An exploration of clustering algorithms for customer segmentation in the UK retail market (2023) Analytics, 2 (4), pp. 809-823; Khalid, R., Javaid, N., Al-Zahrani, F.A., Aurangzeb, K., Qazi, E.-U.-H., Ashfaq, T., Electricity load and price forecasting using Jaya-long short term memory (JLSTM) in smart grids (2020) Entropy, 22 (1), p. 10; Khalil, R.A., Saeed, N., Masood, M., Fard, Y.M., Alouini, M.-S., Al-Naffouri, T.Y., Deep learning in the industrial internet of things: potentials, challenges, and emerging applications (2021) IEEE Int Things J, 8 (14), pp. 11016-11040; Li, K., Shen, N., Kang, Y., Chen, H., Wang, Y., He, S., Livestock product price forecasting method based on heterogeneous GRU neural network and energy decomposition (2021) IEEE Access, 9, pp. 158322-158330; Liang, F., Zhang, H., Fang, Y., The analysis of global RMB exchange rate forecasting and risk early warning using ARIMA and CNN model (2022) J Organ End User Comput (JOEUC), 34 (8), pp. 1-25; Lu, T., Chen, X., McElroy, M.B., Nielsen, C.P., Wu, Q., Ai, Q., A reinforcement learning-based decision system for electricity pricing plan selection by smart grid end users (2020) IEEE Trans Smart Grid, 12 (3), pp. 2176-2187; Metin, A., Kasif, A., Catal, C., Temporal fusion transformer-based prediction in aquaponics (2023) J Supercomput, 2023, pp. 1-25; Mishra, S., Tyagi, A.K., The role of machine learning techniques in internet of things-based cloud applications (2022) .

It spreads worldwide and reaches people rapidly due to its massive benefits and trading approach. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of the e-commerce industry, providing retailers with new and innovative ways to manage and grow their business. One of AI's key advantages is its capacity to offer tailored product recommendations based on user information including shopping patterns, search terms, and browsing habits. By using AI algorithms to analyze this data, retailers can offer customers relevant product recommendations that are more likely to result in a sale. Automating customer support is a further area where AI is useful. Chatbots that are driven by AI can offer all times, immediate service to customers, increasing their satisfaction and speeding up response times. Retailers may now streamline their customer care procedures and concentrate on other aspects of their businesses thanks to this. By forecasting demand, identifying popular products, and ensuring that the relevant products are in stock at the appropriate moment, AI can assist merchants in streamlining their inventory management procedures. Retailers can lower the risk of overstocking or understocking products, which can result in missed sales and lower profitability, by using AI to manage inventory. Furthermore, AI can be used for fraud detection by analyzing customer behavior, purchase history, and other data points. This helps retailers to prevent fraudulent transactions and reduce chargebacks, which can result in significant financial losses. Finally, by examining competition prices, demand, and other factors, AI can assist businesses in optimizing their pricing strategy. By setting the right price, retailers can maximize profits and increase sales. The Main objective of this work is, using advanced technologies to analyze the Ecommerce data and prediction of sales accurately.

This study was conducted with the intention of determining whether or not the application of machine learning (ML) and business intelligence (BI) could result in the development of dynamic pricing strategy that are more successful. Many companies have been unsuccessful because they relied on pricing techniques that had become obsolete as a result of the constantly shifting nature of the digital market. This study addresses the need for a more dynamic and data-driven pricing approach in online environments, thereby bridging a gap in the existing body of research on the topic. Although machine learning has been shown to be helpful in a variety of business contexts, its potential for dynamic pricing in online stores has not yet been completely explored through its integration with business intelligence. This is despite the fact that machine learning has been valuable in a number of business situations. The currently available research does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the synergies that can be achieved by combining ML and BI in pricing optimisation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM), a machine learning technique, was selected as the primary tool for this study because of its ability to deal with intricate and nonlinear interactions included within enormous datasets. Combining technologies that are used for business intelligence in order to collect, process, and present important data results in the creation of a sophisticated framework that can be used to make decisions regarding pricing in real time. According to the findings, having a business intelligence system that is empowered with machine learning significantly improves a company's capacity to accurately price its products and services and to respond rapidly to changes in the market. Price decisions can be made that are both more precise and more sensitive to nuances thanks to the adaptability of the SVM model to changing market conditions. © 2024 IEEE.;"Business Intelligence; Dynamic Pricing; E-commerce; Machine Learning; SVM";"Costs; Learning systems; Support vector machines; Business contexts; Business-intelligence; Data driven; Digital markets; Dynamic pricing; E-commerce; machine learning; Online environments; Pricing strategy; Support vectors machine; E-commerce";"He, X., Liu, Y., Knowledge evolutionary process of Artificial intelligence in E-commerce: Main path analysis and science mapping analysis (2024) Expert Systems with Applications, 238, p. 121801; Rajalakshmi, M., Saravanan, V., Arunprasad, V., Romero, C.T., Khalaf, O.I., Karthik, C., Machine Learning for Modeling and Control of Industrial Clarifier Process (2022) Intelligent Automation & Soft Computing, 32 (1); Guo, C., Thompson, R.G., Foliente, G., Peng, X., Reinforcement learning enabled dynamic bidding strategy for instant delivery trading (2021) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 160, p. 107596; Krishna, S.H., Upadhyay, A., Tewari, M., Gehlot, A., Girimurugan, B., Pundir, S., Empirical investigation of the key machine learning elements promoting e-business using an SEM framework (2022) 2022 5th International Conference on Contemporary Computing and Informatics (IC3I), pp. 1960-1964. , Uttar Pradesh, India; Wang, C.H., Considering economic indicators and dynamic channel interactions to conduct sales forecasting for retail sectors (2022) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 165, p. 107965; Natarajan, Y., Srihari, K., Dhiman, G., Chandragandhi, S., Gheisari, M., Liu, Y., Alharbi, H.F., An IoT and machine learningbased routing protocol for reconfigurable engineering application (2022) IET Communications, 16 (5), pp. 464-475; Nagy, M., Lazaroiu, G., Valaskova, K., Machine Intelligence and Autonomous Robotic Technologies in the Corporate Context of SMEs: Deep Learning and Virtual Simulation Algorithms, Cyber-Physical Production Networks, and Industry 4.0-Based Manufacturing Systems (2023) Applied Sciences, 13 (3), p. 1681; Raja, R.A., Yuvaraj, N., Kousik, N.V., Analyses on artificial intelligence framework to detect crime pattern (2021) Intelligent Data Analytics for Terror Threat Prediction: Architectures, Methodologies, Techniques and Applications, pp. 119-132; Pattnaik, M., Sunil Kumar, M., Selvakanmani, S., Malhari Kudale, K., Kumarasamy, M., Girimurugan, B., Nature-Inspired Optimisation-Based Regression Based Regression to Study the Scope of Professional Growth in Small and Medium Enterprises (2023) International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications in Engineering, 11 (4), pp. 100-108; Rehman, Z., Tariq, N., Moqurrab, S.A., Yoo, J., Srivastava, G., Machine learning and internet of things applications in enterprise architectures: Solutions, challenges, and open issues (2023) Expert Systems, p. e13467; Damlapinar, M., (2019) Analytics of Life: Making Sense of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Analytics; Chen, Y., Biswas, M.I., Turning crisis into opportunities: how a firm can enrich its business operations using artificial intelligence and big data during COVID 19 (2021) Sustainability, 13 (22), p. 12656; Matrouk, K.M., Nalavade, J.E., Alhasen, S., Chavan, M., Verma, N., MapReduce Framework Based Sequential Association Rule Mining with Deep Learning Enabled Classification in Retail Scenario (2023) Cybernetics and Systems, pp. 1-23; Gunjan, V.K., Vijayalata, Y., Valli, S., Kumar, S., Mohamed, M.O., Saravanan, V., Machine learning and cloud-based knowledge graphs to recognize suicidal mental tendencies (2022) Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience; Rani, K.S., Kumarasamy, M., Pattanaik, B., Jagannathan, S.K., Pattnaik, M., Girimurugan, B., Automating Daily Task in Manufacturing and Production Sites Via Machine Learning Intelligence (2023) International Journal of Intelligent Systems and Applications inEngineering, 12 (7), pp. 47-56. , https://ijisae.org/index.php/IJISAE/article/view/4027; Chauhan, S.S., Yadav, S.P., Awashthi, S., Naruka, M.S., Sentimental Analysis Using Cloud Dictionary and Machine Learning Approach (2023) Cloud-based Intelligent Informative Engineering for Society 5.0, pp. 157-169. , Chapman and Hall/CRC; Al-Turjman, F., Yadav, S.P., Kumar, M., Yadav, V., Stephan, T., (2022) Transforming Management with AI, Big-Data, and IoT, , Springer";English;Conference Paper;Final;;Scopus

Traditional approaches for tackling this problem rely heavily on price elasticity modelling. However, the partial information nature of price elasticity modelling, together with the non-negotiable responsibility for protecting profitability, mean that machine learning practitioners must often go through great lengths to define strategies for measuring offline model quality. In the face of this, many retailers fall back on rule-based methods, thus forgoing significant gains in profitability that can be captured by machine learning. In this paper, we introduce two novel end-to-end markdown management systems for optimising markdown at different stages of a retailer's journey. The first system, ""Ithax,""enacts a rational supply-side pricing strategy without demand estimation, and can be usefully deployed as a ""cold start""solution to collect markdown data while maintaining revenue control. The second system, ""Promotheus,""presents a full framework for markdown optimization with price elasticity. We describe in detail the specific modelling and validation procedures that, within our experience, have been crucial to building a system that performs robustly in the real world. Both markdown systems achieve superior profitability compared to decisions made by our experienced operations teams in a controlled online test, with improvements of 86% (Promotheus) and 79% (Ithax) relative to manual strategies. These systems have been deployed to manage markdown at ASOS.com, and both systems can be fruitfully deployed for price optimization across a wide variety of retail e-commerce settings. © 2022 ACM.";"dynamic pricing; e-commerce; markdown optimization";"Costs; E-learning; Elasticity; E-commerce; Machine learning; Online systems; Sales; Dynamic pricing; E-commerce; Elasticity modeling; End to end; Learning frameworks; machine learning; Markdown optimization; On-line fashion; Optimisations; Price-elasticity; Profitability";"The Advanced Analytics behind Fashion Company Markdowns, , https://www.bcg.com/publications/2020/advanced-analytics-fashion-company-markdowns, Accessed: 2022-02-08; The Dos and don'Ts of Dynamic Pricing in Retail, , https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/marketing-and-sales/our-insights/the-dos-and-donts-ofdynamic-pricing-in-retail, Accessed: 2022-02-08; How Retailers Can Drive Profitable Growth Through Dynamic Pricing, , https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailerscan-drive-profitable-growth-through-dynamic-pricing, Accessed: 2022-02-08; A Refresher on Price Elasticity, , https://hbr.org/2015/08/a-refresher-on-priceelasticity, Accessed: 2022-02-08; Bottou, L., Peters, J., Quiñonero-Candela, J., Charles, D.X., Chickering, D.M., Portugaly, E., Ray, D., Snelson, E., Counterfactual reasoning and learning systems: The example of computational advertising (2013) Journal of Machine Learning Research, 14 (65), pp. 3207-3260; Caro, F., Gallien, J., Clearance pricing optimization for a fast-fashion retailer (2012) Operations Research, 60 (6), pp. 1404-1422; Hernán, M.A., (2020) R.

The Random Forest Regressor (RFR) model has been implemented to achieve a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 8.15% for demand forecasting and 1.11% for price prediction, highlighting its accuracy. These AI-driven insights allow businesses to make smarter, faster decisions, optimize pricing strategy, and adjust inventory levels to meet market demands. Additionally, the model helps avoid surplus or deficit, ensuring seamless inventory flow, reducing operational costs, and improving overall profitability. AI integration into retail processes allows companies to respond dynamically to real time changes and maintain a competitive edge in a fast-paced market environment.;"Demand forecasting; Dynamic pricing; Inventory management; Price prediction; Random Forest Regressor; Retail optimization";;;;Proceedings Paper;;;Web fo science

To further apply the deep reinforcement learning technology to the field of dynamic pricing, we build an intelligent dynamic pricing system, introduce the reinforcement learning technology related to dynamic pricing, and introduce existing research on the number of suppliers (single supplier and multiple suppliers), environmental models, and selection algorithms. A two-period dynamic pricing game model is designed to assess the optimal pricing strategy for e-commerce platforms under two market conditions and two consumer participation conditions. The first step is to analyze the pricing strategy of e-commerce platforms in mature markets, analyze the optimal pricing and profits of various enterprises under different strategy combinations, compare different market equilibriums and solve the Nash equilibrium. Then, assuming that all consumers are naive in the market, the pricing strategy of the duopoly e-commerce platform in emerging markets is analyzed. By comparing and analyzing the optimal pricing and total profit of each enterprise under different strategy combinations, the subgame refined Nash equilibrium is solved. Finally, assuming that the market includes all experienced consumers, the pricing strategy of the duopoly e-commerce platform in emerging markets is analyzed.;"Deep reinforcement learning; e-commerce platform; dynamic evaluation; game model; pricing strategy";;;;Article;;;Web fo science

Promotion optimization for consistent pricing retailers is a challenging problem, as they need to decide which products to promote, with no historical price elasticity information for the candidate products. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for predicting product price elasticity impact for e-commerce retailers who use a consistent pricing strategy. We combine the commonly used operation research-based log-log demand model with the nonlinear gradient boosting machines algorithm to predict the price elasticity impact of products with no historical price elasticity information. A pessimistic prediction interval measure is used to accelerate the learning period and reduce the probability of selecting low impact promotions due to high model prediction uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a real-world dataset collected from an online European department store.;"Online stores; Promotion optimization; Decision making";;;;Article;;;Web fo science
